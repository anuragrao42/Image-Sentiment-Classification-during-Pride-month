# Image-Sentiment-Classification-during-Pride-month
I have categorized quotes that are uploaded during Pride Month on the basis of its sentimentâ€”positive, negative, and random. 
Task is to build a sophisticated Machine Learning model combining Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to assess sentiments of these quotes.

The image_senti.ipynb file uses pytesseract to extract text from images.
Then, text_detect.ipynb file analyzes the text sentiment using pretrained flair model.
